<span class="small-note">[https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/03/11/drive-labs-multi-view-lidarnet-self-driving-cars/](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/03/11/drive-labs-multi-view-lidarnet-self-driving-cars/)</span>

Note:
- One of the most well developed applications of DL is in self driving cars

Lidar can give autonomous vehicles laser focus. By bouncing laser signals off the surrounding environment, these sensors can enable a self-driving car to construct a detailed and accurate 3D picture of whatâ€™s around it.
-  cars, trucks, buses, pedestrians, cyclists, and other road users.

Note:
Deepfakes are synthetic media[2] in which a person in an existing image or video is replaced with someone else's likeness.

Obviously dangerous but there is also ongoing research into using deep learning to detect deep fakes.

<span class="small-note">DeepTerramechanics: Terrain Classification and Slip Estimation for Ground Robots via Deep Learning, R. Gonzalez, K. Iagnemma</span>

Note:
Terramechanics plays a critical role in the areas of ground vehicles and ground mobile robots since understanding and estimating the variables influencing the vehicle-terrain interaction may mean the success or the failure of an entire mission.

This research applies state-of-the-art algorithms in deep learning to two key problems: estimating wheel slip and classifying the terrain being traversed by a ground robot

### Definitions

<img src="assets/img/ai-definition.svg" class="plain" style="width:70%"/>


**Artificial Intelligence (AI)**:  The effort to automate intellectual tasks normally performed by humans.

**Machine Learning (ML)**: A sub topic in AI that aims to perform tasks by learning patterns in data.

**Deep Learning (DL)**: A technique to perform ML based on neural networks.

<font size='6'> Reference: *Chollet, F., 2021. Deep learning with Python. Simon and Schuster.* </font>

Note:
These definitions are very debatable and are simplified.

---

### Machine Learning (ML)

Statistical models that learns from data

<img src="assets/img/ml_paradigm.png" class="plain" style="background: white; " />

Note:
    - Classical programming depends on rules. I.E. Do certain mathematical processing to transform x to y.
    - Machine learning allows the algorithm to build its own rules simply by observing patterns between x and y.

---

### A simple ML model

<object type="image/svg+xml" data="assets/img/ml-model.svg"></object>

e.g. predicting house price from no. of bedrooms <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->


<object type="image/svg+xml" data="assets/img/ml-model-houseprice.svg">
<param id="layer1" class="fragment" />
</object>


---

### Learning by examples
ML models learn by being shown many examples. Each example is a pair of Feature (input) and Label (desired output).

<table>
<tr><th>Feature (No. of bedrooms)</th><th>Label (Sale Price)</th></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>185,000</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>70,000</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>250,000</td></tr>
</table>
<br/>
<object type="image/svg+xml" data="assets/img/feature-label.svg">
<param id="layer1" class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" />
<param id="layer2" class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" />
</object>




---

### Feature engineering
Real-world applications often does not map neatly to a single feature

e.g. here's what happens when we plot using real data:<br/>
<img src="assets/img/bedroom-saleprice.png" class="plain" style="background: white; width: 30%" />

---

### Feature engineering
It's possible to use multiple features in our model...

What other features should we collect?

Note:
Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge to extract features from raw data.
---


### Feature engineering
Examples of features with higher correlation:


<div style="display:flex; width: 100%">
    <div style="flex-grow: 1">
    Overall quality of the finish <br/><img src="assets/img/overallqual-saleprice.png" class="plain" style="background: white; " />
    </div>
    <div style="flex-grow: 1">
    Ground floor living area <br/> <img src="assets/img/groundlivingarea-saleprice.png" class="plain" style="background: white;" />
    </div>
</div>

---

### Feature engineering
* We want to choose features most relevant to our model e.g. ones with high correlation

* It's possible to combine and transform multiple features to increase correlation and help our ML algorithms e.g.

    ```html
    Total area = Garden area + Ground floor area + Second floor area + ...
    ```

* Often requires domain knowledge and intuition about the dataset

### Feature engineering

What if we want to create a model that detect cats?

<img src="assets/img/cat.jpeg" class="plain" style="background: white; width: 30%" />

Each feature is a scalar value

---

### Feature engineering

Cat detector:

<div style="display:flex; width: 100%">
    <div style="flex-grow: 1">
        <img src="assets/img/cat.jpeg" class="plain" style="background: white; width: 60%" />
    </div>
    <div style="flex-grow: 1">
    Possible features (Low -> High level)
        <ul>
            <li>Colours</li>
            <li>Edges</li>
            <li>Shapes</li>
            <li>Texture</li>
            <li>Anatomy (ears, eyes, mouth, face, limbs, etc.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>

---

### Feature engineering

Cat detector:

---

### ML Methodologies
We can use various algorithms as the 'model', DL is one of them...

* Clustering (e.g. K-means)
* Bayes
* Decision trees
* Regression
* State vector machines (SVM)
* Deep Learning (Neural Networks)
* etc.

---

### Deep Learning

Uses 'deep' neural networks, i.e. neural network with many layers.

<img src="assets/img/neuralnetwork.svg"  style="background: white; width: 30%"/>

---

### Why use Deep Networks
Standard ML workflow:

<img src="assets/img/ml-cat-detector.svg" class="plain" style="background: transparent"/>

Standard DL workflow:

<img src="assets/img/dl-cat-detector.svg" class="plain" style="background: transparent"/>

Deep layers acts as both model and feature detectors

---

### Hierarchical feature representaion
Deep neural networks learn larger and more abstract features deeper into the network.

<object type="image/svg+xml" data="assets/img/convolution-hierachy.svg" style="background: white; width: 60%; height: auto;">
</object>


---

### Why use Deep Networks
Why is this important?

Imagine trying to convert our cat detector to a car detector:

<img src="assets/img/car.jpeg" class="plain" style="background: transparent; width: 50%"/>

With DL, just supply a different dataset! <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### The convergence

[Alexnet (https://doi.org/10.1145/3065386)](https://doi.org/10.1145/3065386)<!-- .element: class="small-note" -->

Today's state-of-the-art is around 98.7%

Note:
The rise of deep learning has had a clear impact on state of the art performance of machine learning models
---

### DL performance

DL is able to use **more** data to increase performance

<img src="assets/img/ml-dl-data.svg" class="plain" style="background: white; width: 30%"/>

<div>
... but also means you need <strong>more</strong> data to train DL algorithms
</div>

### DL Frameworks

Many DL frameworks are available, most popular being:

* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
  * The easiest framework to use (Keras)
  * Fast
* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
  * Dynamic network graph
  * Network debuggable


---

### DL Frameworks

There's likely a framework for a language that you know e.g.:

* Java - DL4J, Tensorflow Java
* Matlab - Deep Learning Toolbox

Or import from python
* 'keras' package for R - Used for R version of the course

---

### Keras (Tensorflow)

* High-level API for building and training NNs
* Pre-defined components for NN and training
  * Layers, Loss functions, Optimisers, Preprocessors
* Now integrated into Tensorflow

### Installing Tensorflow using conda

[conda(conda.io)](https://conda.io) is a virtual environment and package manager for many languages.
It can be used to create a virtual python environment for installing tensorflow.

It's recommended if you plan to install tensorflow on your machine.

---

### Installing Tensorflow using conda

Once you've installed conda, you can create a virtual environment and install tensorflow with a single command:

```bash
conda create -n my_tensorflow_environment -y python=3.8 tensorflow
```

This installs the latest version of tensoflow on python version 3.8 in the virtual environment named 'my_tensorflow_environment'.
From tensorflow 2.0, the package `tensorflow` supports GPU by default.

---

### Running Tensorflow in virtual conda environment

You must then activate your virtual environment before running any tensorflow code:

```bash
source activate my_tensorflow_environment
python my_dl_script.py
```

---

### Installing other packages

You can also install other packages with `conda` or `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

And it will be installed into your virtual environment

---

## Leaving the virtual environment

If you want to exit your conda environment, just run:

```bash
source deactivate
```
