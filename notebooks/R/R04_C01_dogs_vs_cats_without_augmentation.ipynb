        "- The first element contains our **features (images)** in a 4 dimensional array (batch number, height, width, channels). As we are dealing with RGB images, this time each image has 3 channels  \n",
        "- The second element contains our **targets (labels)** and is a 1d vector. This is because we set the `class_mode` to `\"binary\"`. If we'd left it as the dafault (`\"categorical\"`), it would have generated [**one-hot encoded**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BecEHOVmx9o) targets (a matrix of dimensions *batch number* x *classes*) with the correct target class encoded with 1 and all other classes with 0. It's important to check for the shape of the targets as it affects the choice and effectiveness of the loss function when we compile the model. "
